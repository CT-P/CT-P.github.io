I am a [Political Science PhD candidate](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/de/personen/mitarbeitende/ctrina.html) at the University of Zurich (UZH), Switzerland.

My research focuses on political competition, specifically on the use of rhetoric as a tool for parties to attract voters. I am interested in questions such as how populism can be identified in political speech. Under what conditions does populism successfully attract voters, and why? Methodologically, I primarily use machine learning and causal inference to answer these questions.

My PhD is supported by a Swiss National Foundation project on large scale online deliberation.
