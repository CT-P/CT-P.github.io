Contemporary political communication has undergone a fundamental transformation: messages no longer address collectives but target individuals with algorithmic precision that exceeds human personalization. This shift represents more than technological advancement—it constitutes a deliberate fragmentation of democratic discourse, where anti-pluralistic appeals have systematically displaced the shared communicative foundations essential to public deliberation. Democratic conversation now occurs within an eroding landscape of offline social capital, where the velocity of information transmission has inverted traditional assumptions about the accessibility and cost of political speech.

My research program interrogates this transformation through an integrated framework spanning political communication, democratic theory, and computational social science, examining how precision targeting fundamentally alters the structural conditions for democratic deliberation. This investigation centers on three interconnected research questions that drive my scholarly agenda:

**Democratic implications (empirical)** – How does anti-pluralistic political communication interact with individual identity to shape electoral behaviour, and how do offline political discussions moderate and differentiate its rhetorical forms?

**Target definition (methodological)** – How can we systematically identify and classify rare and evolving classes of political narratives—defined by their oppositional poles, such as man and woman—that are used to target particular individuals or groups?

**Epistemological shift (theoretical)** – How does the move from human-generated to AI-generated political communication affect knowledge formation, trust, and disagreement, and how can an imitation-based framework, grounded in epistemic disagreement, improve on existing instrumental models for assessing AI’s impact?


My [PhD](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/de/personen/mitarbeitende/ctrina.html) is supported by a [Swiss National Foundation project on large scale online deliberation]( https://d3-project.ch/science/).
