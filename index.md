My research examines how rhetoric and communication technologies reshape democracy.

I begin by isolating the **democratic consequences of rhetoric**, showing how styles like populism and technocracy shape voter attachments beyond policy content. 

I then extend models of political choice by adding a rhetorical dimension and develop **new computational tools** to detect and track bias in political text.

Most recently, I explore **political epistemology** in the digital age, analyzing how conversational AI structures knowledge, trust, and disagreement.

Across these strands, my work maps how rhetoric, algorithms, and AI transform the conditions of pluralist democracy.


My [PhD](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/de/personen/mitarbeitende/ctrina.html) is supported by a [Swiss National Foundation project on large scale online deliberation]( https://d3-project.ch/science/).
