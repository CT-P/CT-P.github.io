I am a [Political Science PhD candidate](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/de/personen/mitarbeitende/ctrina.html) at the University of Zurich (UZH), Switzerland.

My research focuses on political competition, specifically on anti-elite rhetoric as tool. How can we identify populism in national parliamentary speeches? Under what conditions does populism successfully attract voters, and why? Methodologically, I primarily use computational social science methods and game theory to answer these questions.
