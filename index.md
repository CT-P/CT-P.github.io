I am a Political Science PhD candidate at UZH. My research lies at the intersection of political representation, deliberation, and cleavages. My main focus is on how we are represented and how that shapes us, analyze it in deliberative practices, mainly political speeches, but also newspapers. I have a dual background in political science and engineering. In my research, I use computational social science methods to address substantive political science questions.
