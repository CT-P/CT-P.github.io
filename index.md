I am a [Political Science PhD candidate](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/de/personen/mitarbeitende/ctrina.html) at University of Zurich (UZH), Switzerland, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Marco Steenbergen](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/en/people/employees/msteen.html) and co-supervision of [Prof. Dr. Andre Bachtiger](https://www.sowi.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Baechtiger-00002/). 
I am currently in my third year of doctoral studies in the chair of political methodology.

I am currently in my third year of doctoral studies. My research focuses on political innovation, specifically how parties identify and respond to emerging voter needs that can be leveraged for innovation. While voters may hold long-standing preferences, it is crucial to understand how parties discover and mobilize around untapped voter concerns. My focus is on how dynamic rhetorical strategies evolve over time, allowing parties to align their messaging with these unaddressed needs. By examining how rhetoric adapts to shifting political environments, my research explores how parties use innovative communication as a deliberate strategy to shape voter behavior and influence electoral outcomes.
