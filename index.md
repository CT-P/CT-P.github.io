Contemporary political communication has undergone a fundamental transformation: messages no longer address collectives but target individuals with algorithmic precision that exceeds human personalization. This shift represents more than technological advancement—it constitutes a deliberate fragmentation of democratic discourse, where anti-pluralistic appeals have systematically displaced the shared communicative foundations essential to public deliberation. Democratic conversation now occurs within an eroding landscape of offline social capital, where the velocity of information transmission has inverted traditional assumptions about the accessibility and cost of political speech.

My research program interrogates this transformation through an integrated framework spanning political communication, democratic theory, and computational social science, examining how precision targeting fundamentally alters the structural conditions for democratic deliberation. This investigation centers on three interconnected research questions that drive my scholarly agenda:

**Democratic consequences of Rhetoric (empirical)** – Voters are increasingly exposed to political messages that reject pluralism. I argue that rhetorical style itself—independent of policy content—can shape electoral behavior. In particular, I focus on two anti-pluralistic styles: populism, which legitimates claims in the name of “the people,” and technocracy, which invokes “the experts.” Drawing on social identity theory, I show that both rhetorical styles activate identity-based attachments that influence vote choice. I test this argument in the United Kingdom by combining a new computational measure of rhetorical style in parliamentary speeches (2009–2019) with constituency-level election returns and individual-level survey data. Using instrumental variables to separate rhetoric from policy content, I find that exposure to populist and technocratic rhetoric increases support for anti-pluralistic parties, especially UKIP. At the individual level, political discussion weakens the effects of populist appeals but strengthens technocratic ones. These results highlight how rhetorical style independently reshapes party competition and challenges pluralist democracy.

**Rhetoric Methodological Tool Extension (methodological)** – Social scientists increasingly rely on automated tools to measure bias in political text, as automated text classification requires less human coding than manual approaches. However, existing methods force scholars to proceed deductively, requiring them to specify bias dimensions ex ante and struggling to discover emergent forms of bias that evolve over time. To enable bias discovery while reducing labeling costs, we propose biasDetect, a new algorithm that combines narrative-level analysis with dispersion-based statistics and change-point detection models. Our approach operates on semantic role structures rather than individual words, uses distributional inference on unlabeled data, and learns optimal time windows from the data rather than fixing them a priori. Validation studies show that with minimal labeled data, our algorithm's classification performance is comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering greater interpretability and lower computational costs. We replicate the results of published studies using only small fractions of their original labeled data, demonstrate cross-lingual applicability on Spanish tweets, and trace fifty years of gendered narratives in U.S. congressional speech. We provide open-source software to implement our method.

**Political Epistemology in Conversational AI (theoretical)** – How does the move from human-generated to AI-generated political communication affect knowledge formation, trust, and disagreement, and how can an imitation-based framework, grounded in epistemic disagreement, improve on existing instrumental models for assessing AI’s impact?
