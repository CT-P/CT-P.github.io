My research examines how discursive, representational, and technological power reshape democracy:

I begin by isolating the **democratic consequences of rhetoric**, showing how styles like populism and technocracy shape voter attachments beyond policy content. This extends models of public opinion by adding a political system-level rhetorical cue—conceptualized as a property of the party communication system—and linking it to political behavior.


I show that **classification-based methods actively produce greater representational bias than distributional approaches**, demonstrating that methodological choices themselves shape the political visibility of marginal groups.


Most recently, I explore the **impact of AI on political knowledge**, showing the epistemic consequences of acquiring political information through conversational interaction.


Across these strands, my work conceptualizes **power as a systemic, non-coercive force that structures political behavior, representation, and knowledge**: shaping behavior through rhetorical environments, shaping representation through methodological technologies of classification, and shaping knowledge through technological mediation.


My [PhD](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/de/personen/mitarbeitende/ctrina.html) is supported by a [Swiss National Foundation project on large scale online deliberation]( https://d3-project.ch/science/).
