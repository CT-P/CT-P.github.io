My research examines how discursive, representational, and technological power reshape democracy:

I begin by isolating the **populist and technocracy rhetoric** from their messages' policy issue, by creating each a classifier. I use words as an instrument to predict populism and technocracy in political discourse and find their effect on voters. I show that populist and technocratic rhetoric function as elite-generated cues of system-level governance change: citizens process these ostensibly opposing rhetorical styles as equivalent signals through peripheral rather than substantive evaluation. Together, these findings challenge grievance-based accounts, demonstrating that political elites can generate anti-pluralist electoral shifts through strategic rhetorical framing independent of underlying citizen distrust, economic hardship, or identity threats.


I critically assess that classification-based methods cannot identify, and create a **distributional approach to discover silenced narratives in discourse**, adding a methodological tool to measure discursive silence.


Most recently, I explore the **impact of AI on political knowledge**, showing the epistemic consequences of giving, instead of acquiring,  preferences through conversational interaction.


My [PhD](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/de/personen/mitarbeitende/ctrina.html) is supported by a [Swiss National Foundation project on large scale online deliberation]( https://d3-project.ch/science/).
